# Project Name
> Vector Similarity Search.
This project is focused on implementing vector similarity search using FAISS and sentence embeddings. It allows for efficient searching of similar items in large datasets based on text similarity, and is a great tool for applications such as FAQ search, document retrieval, and recommendation systems.

## General Information
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and efficient way to search for similar sentences or documents using vector embeddings and FAISS for fast similarity searches. This approach leverages modern NLP techniques to represent text as vectors in high-dimensional space, enabling semantic similarity calculations.

## Key Features:
Vector Embeddings: Converts text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning.
FAISS Integration: Efficiently stores and searches vectors using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
User Query Search: Find the most similar text to a user query based on semantic similarity.
This is useful for building systems like FAQ retrieval, document search, or recommendation engines that need to find content based on meaning, not just keywords.

## Conclusions
By leveraging FAISS for vector search, this project allows efficient similarity searches in large text datasets. By using sentence embeddings, the system is able to understand and compare the semantic meaning of text, which is much more powerful than traditional keyword-based searches. With proper indexing, the system is scalable and can handle datasets of varying sizes.

The project demonstrates how to use modern NLP tools to improve user interaction in search-based applications and lays the foundation for building more sophisticated recommendation systems.
